Not too entirely sure what to write here, or what is to become of this blog. Do I talk about traveling, my personal life philosophies, politics, mental health, professional corporate world, pets, love advice, the list goes on! Maybe all of the above? I threw this together due to some inspiration from ChatGPT, and a curiosity to see how far this goes. I mean hell, if Vance and Peter Theil can be influenced so easily by some edgelord pseudo-philosopher who advocates for the masses becomming biofuel maybe I can do some good.

More to come, wonder if the empty line 8 will display?
